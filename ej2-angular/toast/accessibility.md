## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Toast component has been designed keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications, by applying the prompt WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with the keyboard support. Thus, making it usable for people who use assistive WAI-ARIA Accessibility supports that is achieved through the attributes.
It helps to provides information about the elements in a document for assistive technology.
The component implements the keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and tested in major screen readers.
